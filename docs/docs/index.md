# Introduction

This is the design documentation for a web application designed for allotment holders looking to optimize their growing season. The system provides a dynamic, personalized to-do list, helping users stay on top of crucial tasks like watering, feeding, pruning, and harvesting. Along with a collaborative grow guide database, allowing users to share and discover the best techniques for different fruit and vegetable varieties.

!!! note "Please Note"
    The purpose of this documentation is two fold:

    - **Act as the documentation that details the implemented solution.**
    - **Provide a blueprint for creating the system from the ground up.**

    Due to this, all sections detailing requirements are written in the past tense, and detail what the system *should* do. The proceeding sections after ones detailing requirements then lays out how they are realized in the currently deployed solution, and as such are present tense. Providing both the documentation on the implemented solution and the blueprint for re-creating it if desired. Architectural Decision Records (ADR's) are also recorded, providing justification and reasoning for technologies chosen.
